This is a responsive portfolio website, built with the
Node.js-based static site generator Eleventy. It is designed to be
used as a template for an artist or designer to quickly build and
deploy a portfolio website. The repository is intended to be run
in the GitHub Codespaces browser-based remote development
environment, and includes a custom GitHub Actions script to build
and deploy the site to GitHub Pages. This template offers 3
different portfolio layouts, and uses SASS variables to allow the
user to customize the look and feel of the site without writing
any new code. The template is designed to be easy for
non-developers to customize, add content to, and deploy. This
template was built for a workshop I organized and led at SUNY New
Paltz's [2023 Design Week,](https://www.newpaltz.edu/designweek/)
a campus-wide event that explores different areas within the field
of design.
