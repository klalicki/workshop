This is a command-line tool, built in Node.js. It is designed to
be used as part of a production workflow in combination with
InDesign's Data Merge feature, or a similar system. The tool takes
as inputs a folder of image assets and two CSV files containing
parameters for renaming the image assets, and renames them to use
a consistent schema. This tool helps with efficient templated
production of visual asset groups such as banner ads and branded
social posts.
