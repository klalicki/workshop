Hi! I'm a developer & designer based out of Kingston, New York. In
addition, I teach in the Design department at SUNY New Paltz. I grew
up just across the river in Red&nbsp;Hook, NY (the Dutchess County
town, not the Brooklyn neighborhood), and I have a BFA in
Graphic&nbsp;Design from SUNY New Paltz. If I'm not making things,
I'm probably outside, roller skating or riding my bike.

## About This Site

This site is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a Node.js-based static site generator. Script bundling is handled with Webpack. The interactive background at the top of the page is built using [Two.js](https://two.js.org/), a lightweight animation library. The _Sketches_ section is generated programmatically at build time using data pulled from the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest). Currently deployed through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
