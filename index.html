          <h2>Setting Up</h2>
          <p>
            There are two options for deploying your site: GitHub Pages and
            Netlify. Both are free, both have the option to easily connect a
            domain name (such as 'yourname.com').
          </p>
          <p>
            You should use Netlify if you already have a site hosted on GitHub
            Pages at 'username.github.io'
          </p>
          <div class="col2">
            <div class="col">
              <h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Go to the
                  <a href="https://github.com/klalicki/portfolio-builder"
                    >GitHub repository</a
                  >
                  and click 'Use as Template'
                </li>
                <li>Set the repository name to 'username.github.io'</li>
                <li>
                  Go into 'Settings' on the repository, and scroll down to the
                  'GitHub Pages' section. Under 'Build and deployment', change
                  the 'Source' to 'GitHub Actions'.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Still in the Settings tab: On the left side, click 'Actions',
                  then 'General'. Make sure 'Actions permissions' is set to
                  'Allow all actions and reusable workflows'.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Go to 'Actions' in the top tab bar, click 'Deploy Astro site
                  to Pages' on the left, and then click 'Run workflow'. Select
                  'main' as the branch. This will deploy the site to GitHub
                  Pages. This will probably take about a minute to complete.Once
                  it is complete you will have a live URL for your site, which
                  will be `https://username.github.io`.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
              <h3>Netlify</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Go to the
                  <a href="https://github.com/klalicki/portfolio-builder"
                    >GitHub repository</a
                  >
                  and click 'Use as Template'
                </li>
                <li>
                  Go to the Settings tab of your repository. On the left side,
                  click 'Actions', then 'General'. Switch 'Actions permissions'
                  to 'Disable actions'. This will stop GitHub Pages from trying
                  to deploy the site, since we will be using Netlify instead.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Create an account on Netlify if you don't already have one. On
                  the Netlify dashboard, under 'Sites', click 'Add new site',
                  then 'Import an existing project'. Click 'Deploy with GitHub'
                  - it will ask you to authorize Netlify to access your GitHub
                  account.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Select your repository from the list of repositories. On the
                  next page, you can set a site name - this will become part of
                  your site's URL as sitename.netlify.app. You can change this
                  later as well.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Click the deploy button at the bottom of the screen, and
                  Netlify will start building your site. This will probably take
                  about a minute to complete. Once it is complete you will have
                  a live URL for your site.
